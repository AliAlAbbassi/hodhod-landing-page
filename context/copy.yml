the_problem:
  title: Here's the problem
  content: |
    Your SDRs send hundreds of LinkedIn messages every week.
    Most get ignored. The ones that don't? Generic replies that go nowhere.
    Meanwhile, your ideal customers — engineering leaders at companies that actually need your product — never hear from you.
    Or worse, they get a message so generic they immediately tune out.

the_solution:
  title: What if it worked like this
  content: |
    What if every prospect got a message that felt like it was written just for them?
    Based on their role. Their company's tech stack. What they're posting about. Their pain points.
    What if an AI researched every single prospect — their background, their company, what they care about — and crafted outreach specifically for them?
    And what if a dedicated expert managed everything — the targeting, the sequences, the replies — so you just showed up to meetings?
    That's exactly what Hodhod does.

how_it_works:
  title: Here's exactly what we do
  steps:
    - step: 1
      title: We learn your ICP
      description: You fill out a questionnaire. We research your ideal customer — their pain points, motivations, what makes them reply.
      timeline: Day 1-2
    - step: 2
      title: We set up your infrastructure
      description: We configure your LinkedIn accounts, warm them up properly, and set up tracking. No risk to your accounts.
      timeline: Day 3-5
    - step: 3
      title: We build lists and write sequences
      description: We find prospects using buying signals — job changes, funding rounds, tech stack, hiring patterns. Then we write messages that don't sound like every other SDR.
      timeline: Day 5-7
    - step: 4
      title: We run everything, you take meetings
      description: Campaigns go live. We handle connections, follow-ups, conversations. Qualified prospects land on your calendar. You close.
      timeline: Day 7+

faq:
  title: Questions
  items:
    - question: How fast can we start?
      answer: First campaign live in 7 days. Most clients see first meetings within 2-3 weeks.
    - question: Will this get our LinkedIn accounts banned?
      answer: No. We warm up accounts properly, send 20-30 personalized messages per day, and never mass blast. Your accounts stay safe.
    - question: What counts as a "meeting"?
      answer: A booked call with someone matching your ICP who has decision-making power. Not random chats or tire-kickers.
    - question: Do we see who you're contacting?
      answer: Yes. Full visibility. We send you the prospect list before reaching out.
    - question: What metrics do we get?
      answer: Connection rates, reply rates, positive replies, meetings booked, pipeline value. Weekly reports.
    - question: Why not just hire an SDR?
      answer: An SDR costs $70K+ per year, takes 3 months to ramp, and might not work out. We cost less, start in 7 days, and guarantee results. If we don't deliver, you don't pay.
    - question: What if we already have a sales team?
      answer: We plug into your existing team. They focus on closing, we fill the top of the funnel.
    - question: What if it doesn't work?
      answer: You don't pay. 10+ meetings in 90 days or we work for free. There's no risk.
